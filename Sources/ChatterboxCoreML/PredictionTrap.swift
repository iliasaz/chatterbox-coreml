/// Runs `body`, converting an Objective-C `NSException` into a Swift

/// instead of the *process*.
///
/// `MLModel.prediction(from:)` reports most failures as `NSError` (a plain Swift
/// `throws`), but some accelerator faults are `@throw`n as an `NSException` — which
/// Swift cannot catch, so it unwinds past every `do/catch` into `std::terminate`.
/// That is how a Neural Engine `E5RT: No memory object bound to port` killed the app
/// on device (2026-07-26; the input shape that provoked it is now fenced off by
/// `Constants.maxVocoderTokens`, but nothing else guards the general case).
/// ``CBXPerformTrappingExceptions`` is the package's one Objective-C file, existing
/// purely to put an `@try/@catch` in the path — see its header for the caveat on
/// trapping framework exceptions.
///
/// A Swift error thrown by `body` propagates unchanged; only an `NSException` is
/// converted. `label` names the stage in the thrown error so a device log says which
/// model faulted.
